# Hello 👋

I'm Trived, a curious learner seeing developers bring unique, beautiful and useful software to life. My journey into programming is lit ❤️‍🔥 by a desire to create impactful websites and apps of my own. Currently, I have a bit of knowledge in Python and C, and I’m eager to explore CSS, Flutter, HTML, Go, Kotlin, and more. Besides this in my free time, I enjoy watching and reading anime, manga. My ultimate goal is to secure a decent job in the software industry and turn my passion into a profession.
